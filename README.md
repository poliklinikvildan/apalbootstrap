# My Website Project

## Overview
This is a webpage project that showcases a one-page website with various effects, including a parallax scrolling header and sections. The project consists of the following components:

## Project Files Structure
- **index.html**: This file contains the main structure of the webpage, including the HTML content, navigation bar, sections, and footer.

- **style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual styling of the webpage, including the navigation bar, parallax effects, colored container, and footer.

- **main.js**: A JavaScript file responsible for adding a parallax scrolling effect to the header and the second parallax section. It listens for scroll events and adjusts the background positions and element positions accordingly to create the parallax effect.

- **images**: A folder that includes the images used in the project, such as the header background image and the images that surround the container with the long text, along with other assets.

## Webpage Components
- **Navigation Bar**: A Bootstrap-based navigation bar that includes navigation links (Home, My Works, Contact Us), and a responsive menu toggle.

- **Parallax Scrolling Header**: A header section with a parallax background image and centered text. The background image shifts as the user scrolls, creating a dynamic effect.

- **Colored Container**: A section that provides a visually appealing separation from other sections.

- **Parallax Background Section 2**: The second section with a parallax background image and a container with text content. The background image and container content move at different rates, creating depth and a sense of interactivity.

- **Footer**: A footer displaying a copyright notice for the year 2023.
